## Precision Likert

Kathryn Morrison [kathryn@precision-analytics.ca](mailto:kathryn@precision-analytics.ca)  

A package to finally, hopefully, resolve our likert headaches. Will be made public once it's tested and reliable (definitely not yet). 

### To do:
 * Currently this function only works for questions that have a neutral category; need to add option to add questions that have two equal mid-level categories.
 * Lots of testing with various datasets. 
 * Probably a million other things.
