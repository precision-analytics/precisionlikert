## Precision Likert Package by Precision Analytics. 

Kathryn Morrison [kathryn@precision-analytics.ca](mailto:kathryn@precision-analytics.ca)  

A package to finally, hopefully, resolve our likert plot headaches. This is a public repo but is currently a work in progress and should not be used (or used very much at your own risk). 

### To do:
 * Currently this function only works for questions that have a neutral category; need to add option to add questions that have two equal mid-level categories.
 * ~Add first example dataset~ 
 * Add a second example dataset 
 * Change = to <- throughout (mostly done) 
 * Adapt functionalty to plot_ly 
 * Many more features TBD
